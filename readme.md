# pawOS - microkernel written in Rust
Cat paws are cute. They deserve an OS.

Based on os.phil-opp.com guide to writing a kernel in Rust.
Kudos for them!

## More info coming soon
Generally I'm pretty excited for this project. I'm still learning Rust and OS dev so the code may be rough around the edges but yeah... that's it for now.
